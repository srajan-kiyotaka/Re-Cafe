**About Our Program**

In this mini project we tried to make a management system for a cafe in which we have made two  python scripts. 
In one we stored all functions and another is our main program file where we import this function file. Whole program is divided into two parts- 
In the beginning of the program we ask the user to specify that he/she is admin/owner or customer and based on that: 

1. **For Admin/Owner** - We ask for admin ID and Password. 
                     After successful verification of admin we give options for changing menu items, updating menu items, and to see sales details.
   
2. **For a  Customer** - We first show the menu, then ask for order and also give them options to remove and add items till the time he confirms the order,
                     then print their bill. And all these sales details are saved in a text file.


Python script files -

1. Re_cafe_main_page.py (main file) - 
*“This is our main file for the program and in this we import the function file.”*
2. Re_cafe_function.py -
*“ In this file we stored all the functions which we have used in our main file.”*


Text files used-


1. Admin_info.txt - *In this text file we stored the information of Admin and their password.*
2. Cafe_menu.txt- *In this file we stored the menu details.
3. cart.txt - In this file we write the order details of a customer.*
4. Order_history.txt - *In this file we save the sales details.*
